# Name
Adelio Lechuga-Kanapilly. But I also go by Ade!

# Year and Major
I'm currently a junior (ahh scary). I am a Sociology major and a Latina/o Studies concentrator!

# Sewing Experience
My aunt and my mom taught me how to hand sew when I was younger, but I forgot everything I learned. Last semester I took an art class focusing on textiles and I relearned how to sew both by hand and with a machine. Since that class I've been working on a few different projects, and I've been trying to get past beginner level sewing.

# Programming Experience
In the summer between 7th ande 8th grade, I did a coding bootcamp. It was mainly learning html, and similar to learning sewing, I have forgotten everything I learned. What stuck with me most were the memories with the other students in the class <3.

# Hopes for the Class
Throughout this class, I hope to get better at sewing (and actually finish some projects). I also want to relearn the basics of coding, and fully wrap my head around the things we're learning. 

# Boring Fact
I like making spreadsheets.
