[NEED TO ADD ELEVATOR PITCH]

### A fun little fact about me...

I really loved playing tetris in high school (still do), and I accidentally got it banned on my school chromebooks because I got so many other students into the game. Good news is, they only blocked one website, so I just moved to [a different site.](https://tetr.io/)
