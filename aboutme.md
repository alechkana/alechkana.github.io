title: Why Etextiles?
---

I have been working on my sewing skills for the past four months, and it’s been my goal to improve and continue sewing. A few months back, an artist friend of mine released her website as a portfolio of her work. I was inspired to make my own, but I had no idea where to start. If I really wanted to, I could do these as a hobby in my free time. However, I know myself, and I know that I won't finish any projects unless I have an external reason to. E-textiles was one of the few classes that I felt could match both my interest in improving my craft and learning the very basics of coding to make a personal website.

# A fun little fact about me...

I really loved playing tetris in high school (still do), and I accidentally got it banned on my school chromebooks because I got so many other students into the game. Good news is, they only blocked one website, so I just moved to [a different site.](https://tetr.io/)
